Advent Of Code 2017
======================

My solutions to the [2017 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

There's probably nothing of value here unless you're interested in how
other people solved these puzzles. Or you're cheating, in which case,
shame on you!

I do not claim that these are good solutions, but they are solutions. Well, except
for Day 23. I used Wolfram Alpha for that one. Seriously, Eric, I hate you for Day 23.
All the other puzzles almost make up for that, but Day 23 is mean.

These are done using just the Scala standard library. That was my own arbitrary choice.
Using ScalaZ or Cats might make some of these solutions cleaner.

These are puzzle solutions. Don't do this shit in the real world.
